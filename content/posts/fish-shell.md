Fish is very simple and nicely interative shell. 
I've been using it for the past 6 months and i replaced ZSH totally. Here are some of the nicest features i found.

##### Auto complete for everithing
You can just tab in your terminal and it will bring to you sugestions.

##### Man integration
It shows all options that are documented on man (help) about the command

##### Lots of plugins
I installed oh-my-fish and kubernetes plugins. There are a plenty of them! (including nice themes)

##### Web interface
You can run the ```fish_config``` command and it opens a really cool web interface

##### Works out of the box
You don't need to edit any file, just install and replace your old terminal and use it!

##### Nice pics from my terminal


##### "So, thats great, how do I install it?"

As I am a Manjaro user:

```
sudo pacman -S fish
chsh -s /usr/bin/fish
```
