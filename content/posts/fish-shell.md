Fish is very simple and nicely interative shell. 
I've been using it for the past 6 months and it has replaced ZSH totally. Here are some of the nicest features i found.

- **Auto complete for everithing:**
You can just tab in your terminal and it will bring to you sugestions.

- **Man integration:**
It shows all options that are documented on man (help) about the command.

- **Lots of plugins:**
I installed oh-my-fish and kubernetes plugins. There are a plenty of them. (including nice themes)

- **Web interface:**
You can run the ```fish_config``` command and it opens a really cool web interface.

- **Works out of the box:**
You don't need to edit any file, just install and replace your old terminal and use it.
